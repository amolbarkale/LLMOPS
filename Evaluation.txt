LLM Evaluation

Why it necessary ?
1. to understand tht llm understands the context and genres clear and coherent text and provide releavent response
2. Promte ethical and safe user
3. Validate business needs
4. Drives improvement
5. Build trust

Key components LLM evaluation:
1. metrics : Quantitaive like BLEU, rouge that access acurancry and similarity
2. Benchmarks : performance benchamrkls, standard datsset and taasks to compare model perfomance amgainst each otehr
3. frameworks : libs (keras, phoenix, bedrock)
4. Human in loop : huma jusdgement is required

Text similarity and Quality metrics :
1. BLEU score : How much of the generated text works sequecss are the same as the refeecne txt, hioghe = mor simlarity
2. ROUGE score : How much of the improtant content from the reference text is includes in the generated text ?
3. BERT score
4. semantic similarity
5. perplexity

Response Quality metrics:
Fluency score - Does the text sound natuaral and grammetically correct?
coherence score - How good the whole text flow is, that is first sentence then next sentence etc.
Completeness score - Did the model fully answer or folloewed the instructions?
relevance score - Is the answer releavent to the question?
etc.

Safety and Bias metrics:
Toxicity score: harmful or offensive language
Bias detection score: Does the text show unfair stereotypes
Safety refusal score: Does the model say no when asked to do something harmful
